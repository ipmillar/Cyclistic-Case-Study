# Cyclistic-Case-Study
A collection of documents and code associated with a data analysis case study for Cyclistic, a fictional bike share company based on the real Divvy Bike Share company of Chicago

The study focuses on understanding the usage patterns of Cyclistic bikes, particularly differentiating between annual members and casual riders. By examining these user segments, we aim to explore strategies to encourage casual riders to transition into annual memberships, thereby fostering long-term loyalty and generating sustainable revenue for Cyclistic. Additionally, the analysis aims to identify the motivations behind casual riders' decisions to purchase annual memberships and investigate the effectiveness of digital media marketing strategies in influencing their conversion.
